If we had an interval of (180, 190] for a continuous variable, 180 and 190 are not the real limits. Instead, the real limits are given by the interval (179.5, 190.5], with 179.5 being the lower real limit of 180, and 190.5 the upper real limit of 190.\n","\n","Continuous variables affect as well the way we read percentiles.
